# CMU 95869 Big Data and Large Scale Computing 

This repository contains programming assignments from the CMU course 95869. The assignments focus on implementing data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms using Apache Spark for analyzing very large amounts of data. 

## Course Description

 
Companies are being inundated with structured and unstructured as the cost of storage rapidly declines while at the same time being expected to always make the right decisions at the right times. Big Data Analytics techniques and technologies allow organizations to build competitive strategies around data-driven insights and derive value from vast amounts of untapped data.  

This course explores the rapidly developing field of Data Science in the context of data mining and machine learning algorithms for analyzing very large amounts of data. The emphasis will be on large-scale machine learning supported by technologies including Hadoop, Apache Spark and Map Reduce as a tool for creating parallel algorithms that can process very large amounts of data.  

This course aims to achieve two main goals. The first is to introduce students to use Hadoop and Spark and related tools to solve real-world problems. The course will focus on building expertize required to achieve those goals in practice. Students will also have the opportunity to gain and solidify knowledge of the most important contemporary methods of Data Science, and to develop understanding of practical applicability of the studied topics in business scenarios. They will be able learn how to formulate analytic tasks in support of business objectives, how to define successful analytic projects, and how to evaluate utility of existing and potential applications of the discussed technologies in practice.
